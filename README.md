This repository hosts a userscript called **Veo Prompt Artisan Helper**. The script provides an overlay UI for crafting prompts on the VideoFX site.

The main file is `audio_prompting_targeted_fix.js`.

Recent fixes ensure the overlay and its tools menu stay above any page
elements so dropdowns are always clickable.

## Installation

1. Install a userscript manager such as **Tampermonkey** in your browser.
2. Add the contents of `audio_prompting_targeted_fix.js` as a new userscript.
3. Navigate to the VideoFX site and refresh to see the overlay toggle button.
